application stop script fail reason?
    Ans: When you do a deployment, it will actually use the ApplicationStop from your last successful deployment, not your current deployment. 
    It's a common issue when the ApplicationStop scripts have a bug.

    Temp Solution: Copy the deployment and check the option 'Don't fail the deployment to an instance if this lifecycle event on the instance fails'

rake aborted for build stage reason?

Application not running on port 3000 event security group has PORT 3000, reason?
